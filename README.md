## Task
Create a simple application based on ReactJs, presenting a sample dashboard. The user
should be able to:
<p>● display a list of all shopping carts,</p>
<p>● add and remove shopping carts,</p>
<p>● after selecting a particular shopping cart, the user should be able to see the price of each product
contained in the shopping cart, and its price after discount. This data should be
presented on a chart. Product prices shown on the chart should be for
a single product.</p>

API: https://dummyjson.com/docs/carts

<p>● Application testing</p>
<p>● Self-creation of basic UI components.</p>
<p>● TypeScript</p>
<p>● Optimal application configuration (use of latest tools, no unnecessary libraries)</p>
